          GIRL EMPLOYES
          LEAP TO DEATH
          FROM WINDOWS
          New York Is Scene of Grewsome Tragedy,
          Due to Insufficient Protection.

          Persons are Trapped Eyewitnesses
          Describe Efforts to Escape.
          New York, March 23. Long rows of coffined dead on the shedderl
          morgue pier last so used at the time of the Slocum disaster marked
          the work of a fire in the Asch Building, at Greene street and Washington
          place, late this afternoon.
          There were 133 of the coffins at 11 oclock, and more were coming
          in. Chief Croker estimated the dead at that time at 150, but only 142
          dead had been recovered. Eight died in the hospitals, where seventy
          five wounded had been taken. The dead were shirt-waist makers, mostly
          women and girls, employed by the Triangle Shirt Waist Company, of
          which Max Blanck and Isaac Harris were proprietors. The ten-story
          building, owned by Joseph Asch,
          machines on three of the floors,
          down into a rear courtyard.
          When the fire came, men and women leaped into the street by dozens
          and died there. There were fifty-three corpses on the Greene street side
          walk, w hen the reporters got there. There were more dead -at the bottom
          of the elevator shaft, and many more, some of them burned to mere
          skeletons, on the upper floors.
          The women and girl machine operators who were found dead on the
          street had jumped from the eighth, ninth, and tenth, or top, floors. They
          jumped in groups of twos and threeb into life nets, and their bodies
          spun downward from the high windows of the building so dose to
          gether that the few life nets stretched below soon were broken, and the
          firemen and passers-by who helped hold the nets were crushed to the
          pavement by the rain of falling bodies.

          NOT A CHANCE
          FOR THE GIRLS
          Such Appears to Be the Evidence
          of Conditions Surrounding the
          New York Fire
          DOORS SWUNG INWARD
          AND ESCAPES BLOCKED
          Greater Number of the Employes
          Were Unable to Speak English
          Yet There Were No Yiddish or
          Italian Directions
          XEW YORK, March 27. —Fixing the
          blame for tho loss of 142 lives In the
          Washington Square fire Saturday drew
          to a focus the emergency forces of the I
          district attorney's office firs marshal J
          and coroner, stats Isbor department,
          and Borough President McAnnv of
          Manhattan. Dozens of Investigators
          collected available Information and I
          grand jury men turned ths personal
          probers in addition. Tim grand jury
          In formal resolution presented lo the
          court of general ssssions, offereu their
          aid to the district attorney and de
          clared someone should bo prosecuted
          for the disaster.
          Evidence Is Serious
          The investigators found evidence
          that the doors at the exits swung In
          ward, crumpled fire escapes in ths
          air shaft, one fire esctp* blocked by
          the iron shutters when opened in tits
          air shaft, an empty water tank on th.
          roof and the practice prevalent among
          the cutters of lighting cigarettes a
          few minutes before quitting time. All
          of this and what is yet to bo ferretted
          out, will be placed speedily before the
          grand jury.
          Tenement Owners Tried
          The tenement house department
          summoned the owners of half a dozen
          faulty structures to the police court as
          a preliminary step to a far reaching
          investigation of the tenements. Ono
          man was held for violating tho law
          and other cases went over until to
          morrow. Fire Marshal Beeres stated
          today that from his investigations it
          would have required three hours for
          the 700 girl employes to descend by
          one fire escape. There had never been
          a fire drill, nine-tenths of the cm
          i ployes cannot speak English and yet
          j he found no signs in Yiddish or Italian
          pointing to thu exits.
          Illumes a Clguretto
          The fire marshal said he is con
          vinced that a cigarette lit by a cutter
          and thrown into a heap of clippings
          started the fire.
          Thirty-three of the bodies are still
          unidentified. Of theso 133 were taken
          dead from the scene of tho disaster
          and nlno died In hospitals

          Only Fire Escape New York
          Sweatshop Fire Was a Fire Trap
          ——__—_————»
          This photograph shows the only fire escape on the 10-story
          Ascli building in New York, where 144 persons perished in a sweat
          shop fire in the three upper stories. The Iron shutters on the win
          dows which led to the small, flimsy fire escape opened outward so
          that a girl on the fire escape landing could not reach the fire escape
          without closing the door behind her. Many girls fell from this fire|
          escape and were killed on the pavement eight stories below.
          The picture also shows how the steps leading between the eighth
          and ninth stories collapsed with the weight of a few girls. Students
          of the New York university, who stood during the progress of the
          fire at the very window from which this photograph was taken, de
          clare that none of the girls reached safety from the fire escape,
          which was only a cheap, flimsy contraption, installed to comply
          technically with the law.

          MOSTLY EAST SIDE GIRLS
          Fire in Top of Ten-Story Building
          A
          i Occupied as Shirtwaist Factory—
          Many of the Victims Jumped from
          1 Windows, Others Smothered or
          Burned to a Crisp.
          NEW YORK, March 28.—Ome hundred
          and fifty people, nine-tenths of them girls
          from the East Side, were crushed to death
          on the pavements, smothered in smoke
          or shrivelled crisp yesterday afternoon in
          the worst fire New York has known since
          the steamship General Slocum was burn
          ed to the water’'s edge off North Brothers
          island in 1904.
          Nearly all, if not all, of the victims
          were employed by the Triangle Shirtwalist
          company on the eighth, ninth and tenth
          floors of the ten-story lof.t building at 23
          Washington place, on the western fringe
          of the downtown wholesale clothing, fur
          sand millinery district. The owners of
          the company, Isaac Harris and Max
          Blanck, escaped unscathed from the office
          -on -the tenth floor, carrying with them
          over an adjoining roof Blanck’'s two
          yvoung daughters and a governess. There
          ‘was not an outside fire escape on the
          building.
          How the fire started will perhaps never
          "be known. A corner on the eighth floor
          was its point of origin, and the three
          ~upper floors only were swept. On the
          'ninth floor fifty bodies were found, sixty
          three or more were crushed to death by
          jumping and more than thirty clogged
          the elevator shafts. The loss to property
          will not exceed SIOO,OOO.
          Pedestrians going home through Wash
          ington place to Washington square at
          ten minutes to 5 were scattered by the
          whiz of something rushing through the
          air before them. There was a flop on the
          pavement and a body flattened on the
          flags. Wayfarers on the opposite side
          of the street shaded their eyes against
          the setting sun- and saw the windows of
          the three upper floors of the building
          black with girls crowding to the sills.
          There were no fire escapes.
          “Don’t jump, don’t jump!” yelled the
          crowd. But the girls had no choice. The
          pressure of the maddened hundreds be
          hind them and the urging of their own
          fears were too strong.
          Four alarms were rung within fifteen
          minutes. Before the engines could re
          spond, before the nets could be stretched
          or the ladders raised five girls had fallen
          from the eighth and ninth floors so heav
          ily that the broke through the iron roofs
          of the sub-cellar and crashed through the
          very streets into the vaults below.
          NEW YORK, March 26.—Robert. W. De-
          Forest announced tonight that the New
          York chapter of the National Red Cross
          would collect funds for the relief of the
          survivors of the “’ashin%}on square fire
          and that Mayor Gaynor had headed the
          contributions with SIOO. A call for funds
          has been issued by Mayor Gaynor.

          Daring young girl on the flying skis! In slalom. 
          Linda must swerve with split-second timing between poles
          28 Keep
          In next week’s big Olympic
          ski races, watch Linda Meyers.
          She’s an All-American beauty
          and a downhill daredevil
          Squaw Valley, Calif.
          Girl skiers, as any male skier will tell you, are
          the prettiest athletes around. No exceptions
          are the members of Uncle Sam’s Olympic
          women's ski team, going into action against the
          world’s best in the upcoming winter Olympics
          at Squaw Valley. Shown here, for example, is
          happy, outgoing, 22-year-old Linda Meyers, as
          attractive a girl as you’d care to meet coming
          down any mountainside.
          Linda is one of Uncle Sam’s best bets for a
          gold medal in the big meet starting next week.
          Behind her spectacular rise to a top place
          among America’s girl skiers lies a drama
          involving a bribe, a tragedy and a bright idea.
          The "bribe” went to Dave McCoy, Linda's
          high-school coach at Bishop, Calif., and her
          biggest rooter today. McCoy, who has taught
          a dozen stars the tricks of the ski trade, just
          didn’t think Linda would ever amount to much
          as a skier. "She had hardly any natural
          talent,” he says candidly. "She certainly
          wasn’t graceful. I told her I didn’t see any

          Athletes Open Action
          In Winter Olympics
          B
          SQUAW VALLEY. Calif.. Feb
          t 19 (AP).—The eighth Winter
          t Olympic Games get down to
          j business today. The athletes
          take over and start gunning
          for the precious gold, silver and
          I bronze medals.
          And judging by the moving i
          and dignified opening day
          ceremonies—which drew raves
          from almost everyone here
          1 from home and abroad—this,
          still could be a magnificent
          show if the weatherman co- i
          operates.
          I The prediction for competi-
          J tion starting at 11 am. 'Wash
          ington time' and running
          through the afternoon-and-
          night hockey games was for
          partly cloudy weather with a
          high temperature of 40 in mid-
          day.
          48 Skiers Entered
          r The Scandinavians were ex
          pected to dominate the first
          event, the men's 30-kilometer
          (18 64 miles) cross-country ski
          race scheduled for 11 a.m.
          Forty eight long distance
          skiers were entered in the
          cross-country at McKinney
          Creek, 17 miles from here.
          I i This, however, figured to be
          D-1
          a battle among Finland's Veikko
          Hakulinen, the defending cham
          pion; Sixten Jernberg, Swe
          den’s “king of the skis”; Nor
          way's Hallgeir Brenden, and
          Kalevi Hamalainen, another
          veteran Finnish ace. Russia’s
          crack Pavel Kolchin was with
          drawn because of illness. He
          had a cold and was running a
          temperature.
          The United States, as usual,
          wasn't given a chance for a
          medal in this grind. Uncle Sam's
          I entries include Leo Massa,
          Lake Placid. N. Y.; Mack Mil
          ler, Crested Butte. Colo.; Sven
          Johanson. Spenard, Alaska, and
          Joe Pete Wilson, Lake Placid,
          N. Y.
          The spectacular Canadian
          team of Bob Paul and Barbara
          (Wagner was the experts’ pick
          |in the pairs figure skating set

          million Blyth Ice Palace.
          Organizers Heartened
          These were the only cham
          pionships on tap following the
          postponement of the men's
          downhill race to February 22
          because of yesterday's heavy

          SQUAW VALLEY. Calif.,c
          Feb. 29 (AP).—America’s Cin-
          derella hockey team, the club
          they said couldn’t win but did.
          provided the climax for the
          B Winter Olympic Games that

          U. S. Athletes Pile Up Olympic Medals
          By TED SMITS
          MELBOURNE M A superhu
          man effort by Tom Courtney in
          the 800 meter run and an amaz
          ing pole vault by the Rev. Bob
          Richards gave the United States
          two more gold medals in track
          and field today and Denmark's
          Emil Denielsen speared a new
          world’s record in the ja- ~’in.
          Yale’s comeback eight and
          Jack Kelly Jr. led a parade of six
          American rowing entries into
          Tuesday’s finals and the Ameri
          can weight lifter moved every
          thing but the Olympic Stadium.
          Bobby Morrow, gunning for a
          100-200-m3534 “double” breezed
          through two heats into the semi

          Thane Baker of Elkhart, Kan.,
          and Andy Stanfield the 2

          a thigh muscle, he is expected to
          be all right for tomorrow’s races.
          Failure of Cy Young to repeat in
          the javelin toss was a major dis
          appointment to the American

          This Was Goldie's Night
          If’ NOT ALL OF THE PROS were present, there were
          enough to properly honor Goldie Ahearn at the Statler. The
          International Boxing Club sent down a contingent, mostly
          guys who'd just seen and who have an interest in Floyd
          Patterson, kayo winner over Archie Moore.
          Harry Markson, the managing director, was on hand and
          so was Murray Goodman, who makes with the words. "We
          never Jhad it so good,” Markson was saying. "This kid Pat
          terson has the fastest pair of hands I’ve ever seen for a
          hatvy weight."
          ‘T’ll buy it,” Goodman was saying in Jim Magner’s suite.
          "There’s a whole new deal in the heavyweight division, w’hich
          is what you’ve got to have if boxing is going to be any good
          at all. We’ve got Patterson, No. 1. He’s 21 years old. Back
          of him we’ve got Eddie Machen, who is only 23.”
          “Twenty-four,” Markson said, tentatively.
          "I looked it up, boss,” Murray said. “Be’a 23, just going
          on 24.”

          Diving Double
          Nets US Sweep
          By TED SMITS
          MELBOURNE W Mre. Pat
          McCormack scored an unprece
          dented Olympic diving “double
          double" tonight when she led a
          1-2-3 American sweep in the plat
          form dive after Murray Rose and
          Lorraine Crapp, two Australian
          teen agers, dominated the final
          night's swimming races.
          Mrs. McCormack, who won both
          the springboard and platform dive
          crowns at Helsinki in 1952, repeat
          ed her double victory. Mrs. Juno
          Stover Irwin of Glendale, Calif.,
          waas second and Paula Jean Myers
          a Southern California coed from
          Glendora, Calif., was third.
          The best Uncle Sam’s men and
          women swimmers could do was
          third place in the final races as
          Rose took the men's 1,500-meter
          free style and Miss Crapp grab
          bed the women’s 400-meter free
          style in record time.
          Despite the diving sweep and
          the brilliant performance by Mrs.
          McCormick, a Lakewood, Calif.,
          housewife and mother, the United
          States could make little inroad into
          Russia’s bulging point total.
          The Russians had already
          clinched the unofficial champion
          ship with a great demonstration
          of strength in gymnastics and
          wrestling. All that remained on
          the Olympic program was tomor
          row’s final soccer game, in which
          Russia is a finalist, and the clos
          ing ceremonies.
          While the athletes were com
          peting before another sellout
          crowd of 5.500 in the Olympic
          pool, several members of the
          Hungarian team were making
          the fateful decision between re-

          Olympic athletes and officials
          from 68 nations today continued
          the rush from Australia back to
          a world of reality which has its
          eyes focused on Suez—not swim
          ming—and Hungary, not hur
          dling.
          Eor them a dream is at an end.
          Their time-consuming efforts,
          which produced four new' world
          records in track and field and
          a host of records in other Olym
          pic sports, will be all but for
          gotten until sportsmen and spec
          tators gather again at Rome in
          four years’ time.
          An Australian band broke
          Melbourne’s quiet Sunday spell,
          marching tin the main thorough
          fare playing ’’Waltzing Matilda.”
          With the passing strains went
          the proud Aussies’ apparent
          recognition that their dream and
          accomplishment —an Olympics
          Down Under—was fast fading
          into the past. All the hopes, frus
          trations and struggles which
          went into making the Games
          perhaps the most successful of
          all time were filed into history
          with the athletic achievements.
          The Games opened nearly
          three weeks ago on a joyous
          note as the athletes happily
          marched into the vast Melbourne
          cricket grounds behind the ban
          ners of their countries. But also
          who could forget the gallant
          Hungarian water polo team as it
          stood on the victory dais on the
          eve of the games’ closing, singing
          with tears in their eyes, their
          pre-Communist national an
          them, “God Save Hungary”?

          HELSINKI. July 19.—The Pres
          ident of the Republic of Finland,
          before 70,000 rain-soaked spec
          tators, today opened the 15th
          Olympic Games, the biggest in
          history and the first to be attend
          ed by Soviet Russia.
          President Juho K. Paasikivi
          and two Olympic officials wore
          formal clothes, the only ones to
          hold to custom on this solemn,
          but sodden occasion.
          As the band played the presi
          dential salute the trio walked
          down the line of the International
          Olympic Committee, shaking
          hands in the downpour.
          Only about half of the Olympic
          officials even bothered to wear
          raincoats. The Finnish Olympic
          Committee stuck to its gray suits.
          Despite the rain, which started
          about an hour before the games
          opened, the Btands were practi
          cally full. Only one side of the
          modernistic stadium is covered.
          Olympic Slogans Flashed.
          After greeting the Olympic of
          ficials, Paasikivi took his seat in
          the President’s box.
          The parade of the 5,870 athletes
          from 69 nations taking part in
          the games followed the alphabeti
          cal order in Finnish, except that
          Greece, as always, came first.
          Finland came last as the home
          team.

          Record Breaking
          Olympic Carnes
          HELSINKI wv—A duel between
          the United States and Russia for
          the victors’ gold medals developed
          today as the fourth day of com
          petition in the 15th Olympic Games
          produced a series of record-smash
          ing performances even greater
          than those of the first three days.
          One world record was smashed,
          anther equalled and five new
          Oiympic marks were written into
          the books in the track and field
          competition, still unfinished.
          Russia took two gold medals in
          wrestling and another in rowing
          as Turij Tjukalov dethroned Aus
          tralia’s defending Champion Mer
          vyn Wood in the gruelling single
          sculls rowing event.
          And the United States scored its
          first victory in Olympic history in
          the pair without coxswain rowing
          when Chuck Logg Jr., son of the
          Rutgers University coach, and
          Tom Price came home in the final
          ahead of Belgium’s pair.
          Adhemar Ferriera da Silva of
          Brazil turned in the most remark
          able of the record-breaking track
          and field performances when he
          surpassed his own listed world rec
          ord on four successive attempts
          in the hop, step and jump. His
          third and winning effort was 16.22
          meters (53 feet, 2.59 inches), about
          eight inches over his own listed
          world mark.
          Two Americans participated in
          the track record breaking and an
          other equalled the Olympic stand
          ard.
          Horacre Ashenfelter, the Glen
          Ridge, N. J., FBI man, won his
          trial heat in the 3,000-meter stee
          plechase in eight minutes, 51 sec
          onds. There is no official world
          record for this event of about a
          mile and three-quarters over ob
          stacles, but Ashenfelter was near
          ly 13 seconds under the Olympic

          Yanks Win Championship In Final Rounds Os Olympic Games
          U. S Wins Title
          By 614 Points
          To Russia’s 553
          By Leo H. Petersen
          9 (United Press Sports Editor)
          HELSINKI (IP) The tumult
          and the shouting died today and
          the fifteenth Olympic games of
          modern times went into the history
          book—an unequalled carnival of
          record-breaking featured by Amer
          ica’s inspired uphill climb to the
          team championship.
          All that remained today was for
          the weary athletes to bid farewell
          to their new friends from other
          #uations and to begin their trek back
          to their homes all over the world.
          And they could all proudly re
          flect that they were part of per
          haps the most fantastic sports
          show of all time, the Slow that
          saw Russia emerge from hahfr,-:
          the Iron Curtain and almost, but
          not quite, beat the U. S. for the
          team title, and the show that saw
          world and Olympic records broken
          176 times in track and field alone.
          The Soviets’ appearance for the
          ■irst time since 1912 was, of course,
          the biggest thing at these games
          which were formally concluded
          yesterday amid colorful pageantry.

          Miss Saubert, 21, considered
          America's best hope for a Gold
          Medal at the Winter Olympic
          Games, flashed through the 66
          gates on the 1.600-meter course
          on the Bellevade slope with a

          Marielle Goitschel, a native

          France, winner of the women's
          special slalom yesterday, was

          Goltschel, Martelle’s sister, was
          fifth with 2:06.10.
          The victory would give Miss

          The first Olympic champion was Coroebus of

          i great foot race staged in a meadow beside the
          river Alpheus at Olympia in 776 B.CV
          It took exactly 1170 years of competition, bicker

          known world.
          The next Olympic champion was not crowned
